# Related Work on ML-based cfPWV Estimation from Wrist Signals

Below is a summary of key recent literature on estimating carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV) or vascular stiffness using peripheral (wrist/finger) signals and machine learning. Each study explores a different approach, signal type, or data source relevant to this project.

## 1. Garcia et al. (2022): Spectrogram + ML for cfPWV

- **Approach:** Transforms single-cycle PPG or BP signals (finger, wrist, brachial) into spectrogram images, extracts image features (energy, moments), and uses MLP/SVR regression to estimate cfPWV.
- **Similarity:** Peripheral signal + ML estimation of cfPWV; also explores noise robustness.
- **Difference:** Uses image-based feature extraction rather than time-domain analysis; only one cardiac cycle and no real-world wrist data.

## 2. Li et al. (2022): XGBoost on Wrist PPG

- **Approach:** Applies XGBoost regression on morphological features from wrist PPG to estimate cfPWV.
- **Similarity:** Wrist PPG, feature-engineered ML regression to predict stiffness.
- **Difference:** Uses advanced ensemble methods; scope and dataset (real vs synthetic) not always clear.

## 3. Smartwatch cfPWV Estimation (2022) ‚Äì Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine

- **Approach:** Evaluates off-the-shelf smartwatches for cfPWV estimation in clinical settings, with high accuracy (CCC ~0.90).
- **Similarity:** Wrist wearable-based assessment aligns with wearable/real-world ambitions.
- **Difference:** Focuses on commercial devices and clinical practicality, not algorithm development.

## 4. WF-PPG Dataset (2025, in press/preprint)

- **Approach:** Dataset containing wrist and fingertip PPG signals under varying contact pressures, with ECG and BP references.
- **Similarity:** Provides real-world wrist PPG data‚Äîdirectly relevant to proposed wearable device integration.
- **Difference:** Focuses on signal collection & variability; does not directly predict cfPWV.
- **Link:** *No direct publication link yet‚Äîadd when available.*

## 5. Smartphone PPG for Vascular Aging (2020)

- **Approach:** Uses ML and CNNs on smartphone PPG to estimate vascular age, a correlate of arterial stiffness.
- **Similarity:** Peripheral PPG + ML/DL for vascular health/aging.
- **Difference:** Predicts vascular age (not cfPWV directly).
- **Link:** [Photoplethysmogram based vascular aging assessment using deep convolutional neural networks](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-15240-4)

## 6. In-vivo Wrist PPG ML for Inter-Beat Intervals (2023)

- **Approach:** ML predicts inter-beat intervals (IBI) from wrist PPG and derivatives + demographics.
- **Similarity:** Wrist PPG analysis, time-domain feature extraction.
- **Difference:** Focuses on heart rate (IBI), not arterial stiffness.
- **Link:** *No direct publication link found‚Äîadd when available.*

## 7. Jin et al. (2021): cfPWV from Radial Pressure (PLoS ONE)

- **Approach:** Uses Gaussian Process Regression on extracted features and RNN on full radial pressure waveforms, tested on both Twins UK and synthetic PWDB data.
- **Similarity:** Peripheral waveform + feature-based and end-to-end ML for cfPWV; synthetic and human data.
- **Difference:** Uses pressure (applanation tonometry), not free-hand wrist PPG.
- **Link:** [Non-invasive assessment of arterial stiffness using radial pressure wave and machine learning: Application in the Twins UK cohort and in-silico data](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0256551)

## üîç Highlights & Project Novelty

- Most prior work uses either synthetic or clinical radial pressure, or finger/wrist PPG, but rarely both synthetic **and** real wrist PPG in a unified ML pipeline.
- **This project stands out by:**
    - Combining two synthetic datasets (HaeMod + PWDB)
    - Integrating real-world wrist PPG from wearables
    - Evaluating both feature-based and end-to-end ML (possibly including spectrograms)
    - Including explicit noise/artifact modeling for wrist wearables
