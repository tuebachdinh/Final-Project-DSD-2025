# Pulse Wave DataBase Algorithms

This toolbox contains Matlab &reg; algorithms used to create and analyse a database of simulated arterial pulse waves, which is described [here](https://peterhcharlton.github.io/pwdb).

## Versions:

### Version 0.1

Version 0.1 was used in the revised submission of the following publication:

Charlton P.H. *et al.* [**Modelling arterial pulse waves in healthy ageing: a database for in silico evaluation of haemodynamics and pulse wave indices**](https://peterhcharlton.github.io/pwdb/pwdb_article.html), [Under Review]

Please see the [README](https://github.com/peterhcharlton/pwdb/tree/master/pwdb_v0.1) for this version for further details.

### Version 1.0

Version 1.0 (under preparation) will be used in the final published version of the following publication:

Charlton P.H. *et al.* [**Modelling arterial pulse waves in healthy ageing: a database for in silico evaluation of haemodynamics and pulse wave indices**](https://peterhcharlton.github.io/pwdb/pwdb_article.html), [Under Review]

Please see the [README](https://github.com/peterhcharlton/pwdb/tree/master/pwdb_v1.0) for this version for further details.
