*all the important data in a single Matlab Â® file*

This page provides details of the contents of the *pwdb_data.mat* file. The file contains a single structure called *data*, with three fields:

* *[data.config](#dataconfig)*: Details of the model configuration used for each virtual subject
* *[data.waves](#datawaves)*: The simulated PWs at common measurement sites for each virtual subject
* *[data.haemods](#datahaemods)*: Haemodynamic parameters extracted from PWs for each virtual subject
* *[data.pw_inds](#datapw_inds)*: PW indices extracted from PWs for each virtual subject
* *[data.plausibility](#dataplausibility)*: The haemodynamic plausibility of each virtual subject

The contents of each of these fields are now described.

## *data.plausibility*

This structure reports the physiological plausibility of each virtual subject's BPs. Plausibility was assessed using the approach described in the [*Generating a Database of Arterial Pulse Waves* Section](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/ajpheart.00218.2019#_i11) of [this article](https://peterhcharlton.github.io/pwdb/pwdb_article.html).

It contains the following fields, with a value for each virtual subject. Note that some fields are followed by an abbreviation indicating arterial site:
* *implaus_sims* - the subject numbers (_..._el_) and the cardiovascular variations used in their simulations (_..._vars_, as defined by _var_names_) which were deemed to be implausible for each plausibility criterion (brachial SBP - _SBP_b_; brachial DBP - _DBP_b_; brachial PP - _PP_b_; brachial MBP - _MBP_b_; aortic SBP - _SBP_a_; aortic PP - _PP_a_; PP amplification - _PP_amp_; these are described in [the accompanying article](https://peterhcharlton.github.io/pwdb/pwdb_article.html)).
* *all_implaus_sims* - similar information on all of the physiologically implausible virtual subjects (rather than separated according to each plausibility criterion).
* *plausibility_log* - a logical vector indicating whether or not each virtual subject was deemed to be physiologically plausible: 1- physiologically plausible; 0 - physiologically implausible.
