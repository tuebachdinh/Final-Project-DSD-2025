# Pulse Wave DataBase Algorithms: v.0.1

This version of the toolbox contains the algorithms used in the revised submission of the following publication:

Charlton P.H. *et al.* [**Modelling arterial pulse waves in healthy ageing: a database for in silico evaluation of haemodynamics and pulse wave indices**](https://peterhcharlton.github.io/pwdb/pwdb_article.html), [Under Review]

The algorithms are provided in Matlab &reg; format.

## Summary of Publication

In this article we will describe the design and verification of the [Pulse Wave Database](https://peterhcharlton.github.io/pwdb/pwdb.html), and illustrate its utility through a series of case studies.

## Replicating this Publication

The work presented in this publication can be replicated as follows:

*   If you wish to reproduce the Pulse Wave DataBase (PWDB), then follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/peterhcharlton/pwdb/wiki/Reproducing-the-Pulse-Wave-Database).
*   If you want to reproduce the analysis of the Pulse Wave DataBase (without re-creating it from scratch), then follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/peterhcharlton/pwdb/wiki/Reproducing-the-Analysis), using Version 1 of the toolbox of algorithms.
*   If you want to recreate the figures and tables in this publication, then follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/peterhcharlton/pwdb/wiki/Reproducing-the-Article-Figures).

## Further Resources

The accompanying [Wiki](https://github.com/peterhcharlton/pwdb/wiki) acts as a user manual for the algorithms presented in this repository. In addition, the supplementary material of the [article](https://peterhcharlton.github.io/pwdb/pwdb_article.html) provides details of the contents of the PWDB files.
