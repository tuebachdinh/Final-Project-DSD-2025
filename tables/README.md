# Tables Directory

This directory contains performance metrics and results tables generated from the deep learning analysis pipeline. This later is used to generate chart in images/part9_models_comparison/ folder. This can also be used to know which model performs the best.

## File Structure

### Performance Tables
- **`part9_table_clean_9x4.csv`** - Model performance metrics for clean data training
- **`part9_table_augmented_9x4.csv`** - Model performance metrics for augmented data training  
- **`part9_table_merged_sorted_18x4.csv`** - Merge from the two above tables

### Utility Scripts
- **`merge_table.m`** - MATLAB script to merge and sort performance tables

## Table Structure

### Individual Tables (9×4 format)
Each table contains **9 rows × 4 columns**:

**Rows** (Model × Input combinations):
- CNN + PPG
- CNN + Area  
- CNN + Both
- GRU + PPG
- GRU + Area
- GRU + Both
- TCN + PPG
- TCN + Area
- TCN + Both

**Columns** (Performance metrics):
- **R2** - Coefficient of determination (higher = better)
- **RMSE** - Root mean square error in m/s (lower = better)
- **MAE** - Mean absolute error in m/s (lower = better)
- **training_time** - Training duration in seconds

### Merged Table (18×4 format) 
Combined table with additional **Data_Type** column:
- **18 rows**: 9 model configurations × 2 data types (clean/augmented)
- **5 columns**: Model, Input, Data_Type, R2, RMSE, MAE, training_time


## Table Generation

Tables are automatically generated by:
1. **`summarize_metrics_create_table.m`** - Extracts metrics from saved models
2 **`merge_table.m`** - Combines clean and augmented results
